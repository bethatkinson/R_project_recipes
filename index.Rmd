# Preface {-}


This book contains R recipes for typical analyses done for medical research projects.  The objectives of this book:

* Create Mock projects and analyze the data using R
* Give people code snippets that they can use for their own projects
* Show how the various packages and functions fit together
* Recommend key packages for summarizing data 
* Provide links for further study
* Model best practices for coding
* Encourage the use of RStudio and R markdown

The assumption is that users will have some basic knowledge of R.  Instead of re-creating introductory information or extended lists of options, we have chosen to provide one way of doing the analysis (with a perhaps a few more at the end of each scenario).  Links are provided to other resources for more education. 

## Getting Started

* Although not required, we strongly encourage that users work through these examples using RStudio.  RStudio is an integrated environment that includes an editor to write code, a console to execute code, a workspace to view objects in your session, a help window, and much more.  Information on using RStudio can be found at [https://moderndive.netlify.com/1-getting-started.html](https://moderndive.netlify.com/1-getting-started.html). 

* Most of the functions used in this book are from base R or tidyverse packages (other packages will be described, when used, throughout this book).  Direct links to packages used for each scenario are included at the end of the scenarios. 

    - Tidyverse is a collection of packages designed to work together to solve data science problems.  The figure below includes the stages of an analysis and the tidyverse packages developed for each stage.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('images/Tidyverse.png')
```

Core tidyverse packages can be loaded into your R session with `library(tidyverse)`. The function `tidyverse_packages()` details what packages are in the `tidyverse` while the `search()` command shows what packages have been loaded.  There are additional packages that are considered a part of the tidyverse that are not automatically loaded.  Highlights of some of the key tidyverse packages are shown in the appendix. 

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) # load basic tidyverse packages
search() # see what was loaded

tidyverse_packages(include_self=TRUE) # list all packages in tidyverse
```

## R markdown

R markdown (file extention `.Rmd`) is a simple way to integrate R output and text, then output as HTML, PDF, or Word. The syntax is pretty basic (e.g., a bulleted list is simply an astrix `*` followed by text).  R markdown is much easier to compile and explore using RStudio, thought it can be run using R from a terminal window.  There is a lot of documentation available on getting started with R Markdown including:

* [RStudio cheatsheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/)
* [RStudio webinar archives](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/)


## The Data

There are separate datasets used for each scenario.  They are based on real data but certain variables are simulated or perturbed.  Patient ID numbers have all been fabricated.  

You can try the exercises out by first [downloading the data]( ) to your home directory or read in the data from the Github page using the provided code.  The exercises assume that you have the files in a subdirectory called "data" that is in the same directory as your programs.

## Scenarios  

Scenario 1: Getting Familiar with a New Project

* In this scenario, you are starting a new project and want to get familiar with the data.  It covers:
    - Import Data 
    - Explore Data 
          + Identify and deal with strange values and duplicate observations
          + Generate summary statistics
    - Plot Data
    - Fit a simple model

Scenario 2: Modeling and Plotting with Cleaned Data 

* In this scenario, you already cleaned your data but want to do more complex models and plots.  
    - Deal with missing data
    - Plot Kaplan Meier & cumulative incidence curves
    - Run linear, logistic & Cox models
            
Scenario 3: Working with Multiple Observations per Subject 

* In this scenario you will work with multiple observations per subject as is often found in longitudinal data.
     - Explore and clean baseline data 
     - Using a cleaned version of the full dataset (up to 4 visits per subject), transform the data from 1 obs/subject to 1 obs/subject/visit. 
     - Plot the data with separate lines for each subject
     - Fit linear models and linear mixed effects models

## Finding help

There are several ways to find additional help. 

* Using the help function.  These are to remind the user of the argument names, but are not extensive.

```
help(foo)       # brief help/syntax about function foo
?foo            # same thing
example(foo)    # show an example of function foo
apropos("foo")  # list all functions containing the string "foo"
```

* Vignettes.  These generally provide more detailed examples if they are available.

```
vignette()         # show available vignettes in loaded packages
vignette("foo")    # show specific vignette
```

Or search the web for "R vignette foo"

    + Use key "R" words like ggplot: [ggplot add horizontal line](https://www.google.com/search?q=ggplot+add+horizontal+line)
    + Check the date of the posting, especially for code relating to the tidyverse.  It is still relatively new and the coding has changed over time.  

## Disclosure

The solutions presented here are one way to do things (usually the "easy" way), and there was a lot of discussion about which was the "easy" way. Alternative solutions are presented in the appendix.
